# When no CA certificates are specified the Shared System Certificates
# are in use. In order to have these available along with the ones specified
# by TLS_CACERTDIR one has to include them explicitly:
#TLS_CACERT	/etc/pki/tls/cert.pem

# System-wide Crypto Policies provide up to date cipher suite which should
# be used unless one needs a finer grinded selection of ciphers. Hence, the
# PROFILE=SYSTEM value represents the default behavior which is in place
# when no explicit setting is used. (see openssl-ciphers(1) for more info)
#TLS_CIPHER_SUITE PROFILE=SYSTEM

# Turning this off breaks GSSAPI used with krb5 when rdns = false
