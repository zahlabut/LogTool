# * LEGACY: Ensures maximum compatibility with legacy systems (64-bit
#   security)
#
# * DEFAULT: A reasonable default for today's standards (112-bit security).
#
# * FUTURE: A level that will provide security on a conservative level that is
#   believed to withstand any near-term future attacks (128-bit security).
#
# * FIPS: Policy that enables only FIPS 140-2 approved or allowed algorithms.
#
# After modifying this file, you need to run update-crypto-policies
